# 🌾 Nori Farm – AI-Driven Delivery Automation

This project automates backend logistics for **Nori Farm**, a Web3 platform where users grow virtual crops and receive real-world agricultural deliveries.

---

## ✅ Problem Solved

Nori Farm lacked automation to:
- Match NFT crop ownership (`Wallet_ID`) with delivery addresses
- Notify operations when crops are ready to harvest
- Summarize weekly delivery logs
- Generate and share delivery-ready CSV files

---

## 🔧 Features Implemented

1. **Auto-matching Wallet IDs to User Info**  
   Matches `NFT_Ownership` sheet with `User_Addresses` to prepare delivery details.

2. **Telegram Notifications for Crop Readiness**  
   Uses Make.com to alert via Telegram when harvest date is due.

3. **AI-Generated Weekly Summary**  
   Uses Groq API (LLaMA3) with Apps Script to summarize delivery logs weekly.

4. **Delivery CSV Generator with Telegram Bot**  
   Filters records ready for delivery and sends `.csv` to a Telegram chat automatically.

## 📄 How to Use the `.gs` Script File

> The file `Script_Code.gs` contains the main automation code written in **Google Apps Script**.  
If you're a beginner, follow these simple steps to use it:

### 🪜 Steps:
1. Open your Google Sheets file
2. Go to the top menu → `Extensions` → `Apps Script`
3. Delete any code already there
4. Copy all content from `Script_Code.gs` and paste it
5. Save the project
6. Run the function `exportAndSendCSVToTelegram` (you may need to authorize it)
7. You will get the delivery CSV in your Telegram bot if crops are ready for delivery

> ⚠️ Make sure the sheet tabs are named exactly: `NFT_Ownership` and `User_Addresses`.
